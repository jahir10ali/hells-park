# READ THIS FILE
When you make changes, make sure you make a new branch, do not make any edits
directly to the main branch. This is because it can mess up the code
if the code is incorrect or compatible with the other code we have made!

To make a new branch, click on the bottom left and create a new branch from there.
Put your name and a number as a branch name.

Now you can make edits to this repo such as editing code, creating code and more.

After that make sure you commit these changes. When you commit these chnages,
make sure you put a nice title to it so we know what you have changed.
Make sure to add a description to for more context. 
When you commit these changes, you can directly make a pull request here! OR, you can
now go on GitHub and make a pull request for that code, this means requesting to submit
these changes into the main program. DONE!
